%Several people have guided, aided and supported me throughout the research that led to this dissertation.

I would like to express my deep gratitude toward my advisor, Professor Luiz Albini, for all the guidance he offered throughout the research that led to this dissertation.
His frequent ideas and suggestions were what inspired me to pursue knowledge and be encouraged to find solutions to problems that are far from simple.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Professor Eduardo Todt, who has helped me in ways beyond this dissertation, and my fellow students, Eric, Nelson and Ivan, who always brought interesting conversations.

I would also like to thank my friends, in particular Taiane, Cainã, Douglas, Lucas and Giancarlo for bringing joy to my life for many years.

Perhaps most importantly, I would like to thank my parents, Edison and Lizmari, who supported me throughout the whole process and always reminded me that I was on a path worth pursuing, as well as my grandmother Glacial and everyone in my family.
